## Project Analysis
- Project type: Go YAML parsing library
- Test framework(s): go test (standard Go testing)
- Test command(s): `go test ./...` (YAML parsing and serialization tests)
- Test suite size: YAML library with comprehensive format testing

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio go test ./...`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Go/go test supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Standard Go module structure
- YAML parsing and serialization library
- Comprehensive test suite for YAML format compliance
- Standard Go library patterns

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Go testing
- Should work seamlessly with standard go test
- Library-focused testing (parsing, serialization)
- Standard Go testing patterns

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio using: `go test ./...`
2. Should work without special configuration
3. Good candidate for library testing with 3pio
4. Expected to have fast, focused test suite
