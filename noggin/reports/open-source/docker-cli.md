# 3pio Test Report: Docker CLI

**Project**: docker-cli
**Framework(s)**: Go (go test) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Go command line interface for Docker
- Test framework(s): go test (with gotestsum wrapper)
- Test command(s): `make test` or `gotestsum` (wraps go test)
- Test suite size: Large CLI project with unit and e2e tests

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio go test ./...`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Go/go test supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Go project without go.mod (uses GO111MODULE=auto)
- Uses Makefile-based build system with gotestsum for test execution
- Excludes vendor and e2e directories from unit tests
- Complex build system with Docker containerization

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Go testing
- May need to handle older Go project structure (no go.mod)
- Should work with standard `go test ./...` command
- Make-based test commands might need special handling

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio using direct go test: `go test ./...`
2. Try excluding problematic directories: `go test $(go list ./... | grep -v vendor)`
3. Consider testing with gotestsum compatibility
4. Check if GO111MODULE setting affects test discovery
