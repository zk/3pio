# 3pio Test Report: Axios

**Project**: axios
**Framework(s)**: Mocha (not currently supported by 3pio)
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: JavaScript HTTP client library
- Test framework(s): Mocha
- Test command(s): `npm test` (runs mocha tests)
- Test suite size: ~200 tests (estimated)

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio npm test`
- **Status**: NOT SUPPORTED
- **Exit Code**: 1
- **Detection**: Framework not detected (Mocha not supported)
- **Output**: Error - Could not detect test runner from command

### Issues Encountered
- Axios uses Mocha test runner which is not currently supported by 3pio
- 3pio supports Jest, Vitest, pytest, and go test
- Would need to add Mocha adapter to support this project

### Recommendations
1. Consider adding Mocha support to 3pio test runner adapters
2. Alternatively, could migrate axios tests to Jest or Vitest
3. Many popular JavaScript projects still use Mocha
