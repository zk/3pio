# 3pio Test Report: Kubernetes

**Project**: kubernetes
**Framework(s)**: Go (go test) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Go container orchestration platform
- Test framework(s): go test (with Ginkgo framework for e2e)
- Test command(s): `go test ./...` (massive distributed systems test suite)
- Test suite size: Extremely large codebase with unit, integration, and e2e tests

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio go test ./...`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Go/go test supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Massive Go monorepo with multiple modules
- Uses standard go test plus Ginkgo for e2e testing
- Complex staging directory structure
- Requires significant resources for full test execution

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Go testing
- Should work with standard go test commands
- May timeout on full test suite due to size
- Some tests require cluster setup

### Recommendations
1. Test specific components: `go test ./pkg/...`
2. Use short tests: `go test -short ./...`
3. Consider memory and time limits
4. May need to exclude e2e tests for basic functionality testing
