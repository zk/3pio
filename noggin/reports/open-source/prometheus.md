# 3pio Test Report: Prometheus

**Project**: prometheus
**Framework(s)**: Go (go test) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Go monitoring and alerting system
- Test framework(s): go test (with time-series database testing)
- Test command(s): `go test ./...` (monitoring system test suite)
- Test suite size: Large monitoring system with comprehensive test coverage

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio go test ./...`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Go/go test supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Standard Go module structure
- Time-series database and monitoring system
- Complex testing including storage and query engines
- May include integration tests requiring setup

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Go testing
- Should work with standard go test
- May have resource-intensive time-series tests
- Integration tests might require specific configuration

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio using: `go test ./...`
2. Consider shorter test runs: `go test -short ./...`
3. May need to exclude integration tests for basic testing
4. Expect some tests to be time-sensitive or resource-heavy
