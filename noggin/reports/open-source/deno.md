# 3pio Test Report: Deno

**Project**: deno
**Framework(s)**: Rust (Cargo) / Deno test
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: JavaScript/TypeScript runtime written in Rust
- Test framework(s): Cargo test (Rust) and deno test (TypeScript)
- Test command(s): `cargo test`, `deno test`

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: Not tested
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Detection**: N/A
- **Output**: N/A

### Issues Encountered
- Deno uses its own test runner (`deno test`) which is not currently supported by 3pio
- The Rust components use cargo test which is also not supported
- Complex multi-language project requiring multiple test frameworks

### Recommendations
1. Consider adding support for deno test as it's becoming more popular
2. Cargo test support would enable testing of the Rust components
3. Multi-framework projects present unique challenges for unified test reporting
