- Test command(s): `cargo test` (cross-platform desktop app framework testing)
- Test suite size: Desktop app framework with comprehensive cross-platform tests

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio cargo test`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A

- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Rust workspace with multiple crates
- Desktop application framework (web + native)
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- May include JavaScript/web integration tests

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Rust cargo test
- Should handle workspace testing correctly
- May have platform-specific tests
- Desktop framework tests may require GUI environment

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio to verify workspace handling
2. Consider testing individual crates: `cargo test -p tauri`
3. Some tests may require desktop environment
4. May need platform-specific dependencies for full testing
