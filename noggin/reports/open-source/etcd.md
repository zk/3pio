# 3pio Test Report: etcd

**Project**: etcd
**Framework(s)**: Go (go test) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Go distributed key-value store
- Test framework(s): go test (standard Go testing)
- Test command(s): `go test ./...` (comprehensive distributed systems testing)
- Test suite size: Large distributed systems project with extensive testing

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio go test ./...`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Go/go test supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Standard Go module (go.etcd.io/etcd/v3)
- Uses Go 1.24.0 with modern go test framework
- Large distributed systems codebase with complex testing requirements
- May include integration tests requiring specific setup

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Go testing
- Should work with standard go test
- May have long-running or resource-intensive tests
- Integration tests might require etcd cluster setup

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio using: `go test ./...`
2. Consider shorter test runs: `go test -short ./...`
3. May need to exclude integration tests for basic testing
4. Expect longer execution times due to distributed systems complexity
