# 3pio Test Report: Click

**Project**: click
**Framework(s)**: Python (pytest) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Python command line interface toolkit
- Test framework(s): pytest (with tox for cross-version testing)
- Test command(s): `pytest` (configured with multiple Python versions via tox)
- Test suite size: Comprehensive CLI testing framework

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio pytest`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Python/pytest supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Python project with modern pyproject.toml configuration
- Uses uv for dependency management and tox for testing
- Comprehensive test configuration with type checking (mypy, pyright)
- Multiple Python version support (3.10-3.13, PyPy)

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Python pytest
- Should handle standard pytest execution correctly
- Uses modern Python project structure which should work well
- May need uv dependencies installed

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio to verify pytest execution
2. Ensure dependencies are installed: `uv sync`
3. Check if type checking tests interfere with test discovery
4. Consider testing specific test paths: `pytest tests/`
