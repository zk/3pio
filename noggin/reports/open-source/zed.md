# 3pio Test Report: Zed

**Project**: zed
**Framework(s)**: Rust (cargo test) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Rust code editor
- Test framework(s): cargo test (Rust's built-in testing)
- Test command(s): `cargo test` (text editor testing)
- Test suite size: Large text editor with comprehensive UI and text manipulation tests

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio cargo test`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Rust/cargo test supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Rust workspace with multiple crates
- Text editor with complex UI and text processing
- May require GUI dependencies for editor testing
- Cross-platform desktop application

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Rust cargo test
- Should handle workspace testing correctly
- May have GUI-dependent tests
- Text editor tests may require specific environment

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio to verify workspace handling
2. Consider testing individual crates: `cargo test -p zed`
3. Some tests may require GUI environment setup
4. May need graphics dependencies for full test execution
