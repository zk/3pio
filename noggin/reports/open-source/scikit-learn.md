# 3pio Test Report: Scikit-learn

**Project**: scikit-learn
**Framework(s)**: Python (pytest) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Python machine learning library
- Test framework(s): pytest (with extensive ML algorithm testing)
- Test command(s): `pytest sklearn/` (comprehensive ML testing suite)
- Test suite size: Extremely large - thousands of ML algorithm tests

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio pytest sklearn/`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Python/pytest supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Large Python machine learning library
- Extensive test suite with numerical and statistical tests
- Complex build system with Cython extensions
- Requires scientific computing dependencies (numpy, scipy)

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Python pytest
- Should work with standard pytest execution
- Very long execution times due to comprehensive ML testing
- Numerical tests are computationally intensive

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio using: `pytest sklearn/tests/`
2. Consider running subset of tests initially: `pytest sklearn/tests/test_base.py`
3. May need full scientific Python stack installed
4. Expect very long execution times for full test suite
