# 3pio Test Report: RustDesk

**Project**: rustdesk
**Framework(s)**: Rust (cargo test) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Rust remote desktop software
- Test framework(s): cargo test (Rust's built-in testing)
- Test command(s): `cargo test` (desktop application testing)
- Test suite size: Desktop application with system-level integration tests

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio cargo test`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Rust/cargo test supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Rust desktop application
- Complex system integration (networking, graphics, input)
- May require system dependencies for GUI testing
- Cross-platform desktop application

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Rust cargo test
- Should handle standard Rust testing correctly
- May have system-dependent tests that could fail
- Desktop application tests may require GUI environment

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio to verify Rust testing works
2. Some tests may require display/GUI setup
3. Consider unit tests only: `cargo test --lib`
4. May need system dependencies for full test execution
