  - `pandas/tests/groupby/` - GroupBy operation tests
- **Test Patterns**: Heavy use of parametrized testing
- **Build System**: Complex with Cython extensions and C dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Requires numpy, Cython, and specific pytest version (≥7.3.2)

2. **3pio Performance**:
   - Handled 148 test files across 2 major test runs
   - Total execution time ~133s for 148 test files
   - Average: ~0.9s per test file
3. **Test Discovery**: 3pio correctly discovers and reports test counts

## Full Test Suite Performance Analysis (2025-09-15)

### Test Run 4: Complete pandas Test Suite
- **Command**: `../../build/3pio /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 -m pytest /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pandas/tests/ -q`
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Run ID**: 20250915T192921-wacky-gau
- **Test Discovery**: 3pio reports "207869 test files" (actually test cases, not files)
- **IPC Events Generated**: 189,505 events (48MB IPC file)

### Critical Performance Finding: Event Processing Bottleneck CONFIRMED
- **Test Run Completed**: Exit code 1 (test failures detected)
- **Total Execution Time**: ~44 minutes (19:29:21 to 20:13:43)
  - **pytest execution**: 21 minutes (completed at 19:50:30)
  - **3pio event processing**: 23 minutes (processing backlog after pytest finished)
- **IPC events written**: 189,505 events (48MB file) completely written by pytest at 19:50:30
- **Performance Impact**: 3pio took LONGER to process events (23 min) than pytest took to run tests (21 min)

### Key Observations
1. **Mislabeling Issue**: 3pio incorrectly labels test cases as "test files"
   - Reports "207869 test files" but these are individual test cases
   - Actual test files: ~960
2. **Real-time Processing with Backlog**:
   - 3pio DOES process events as they arrive using fsnotify file watching
   - Uses buffered channel (10,000 capacity) to handle event bursts
   - Processing speed can't keep up with pytest's event generation rate
   - After pytest completes, 3pio continues processing the backlog
3. **IPC File Scale**: 48MB JSON Lines file with 189,505 events for full test suite

### Identified Performance Bottlenecks (Ranked by Impact)

1. **File I/O on Every Event** (HIGHEST IMPACT)
   - Location: `manager.go` lines 214-216
   - Issue: `scheduleWrite()` immediately calls `writeState()` with NO debouncing
   - Impact: 189,505 disk writes for report files
   - Why worst: Disk I/O is the slowest operation

2. **Console Output for Every Group Start**
   - Location: `orchestrator.go` line 708
   - Issue: Prints "RUNNING [file]" for each test file synchronously
   - Impact: ~960 blocking console writes
   - Why bad: Console I/O blocks the event processing loop

3. **Report Generation After Each Event**
   - Location: Throughout `group_manager.go` and `manager.go`
   - Issue: Markdown report regeneration after every state change
   - Impact: Complex string operations 189K times
   - Why bad: CPU-intensive markdown generation repeated unnecessarily

4. **Lack of Event Batching**
   - Location: `orchestrator.go` line 637
   - Issue: No aggregation of similar events before processing
   - Impact: Missed opportunity for bulk operations
   - Why bad: Can't optimize for similar updates

5. **Mutex Lock/Unlock Pattern**
   - Location: `group_manager.go` lines 264-291
   - Issue: Lock/unlock/relock pattern in `ProcessTestCase`
   - Impact: Unnecessary overhead on 189K events
   - Why moderate: Adds latency but not primary bottleneck

### Root Cause Analysis
The code was designed for smaller test suites and doesn't scale to pandas' massive event volume. The combination of:
- **189,505 file writes** (instead of ~10-20 with batching)
- **960+ console prints** (blocking the main event loop)
- **189,505 report regenerations** (instead of once at the end)

Creates a severe performance bottleneck where event processing becomes the limiting factor rather than test execution.
