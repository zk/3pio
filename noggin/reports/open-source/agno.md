# 3pio Test Report: Agno

**Project**: agno
**Framework(s)**: Python (pytest) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: Python Multi-Agent Systems framework
- Test framework(s): pytest (with pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, pytest-mock)
- Test command(s): `pytest` (configured with async support)
- Test suite size: Large framework with extensive dependency matrix

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio pytest`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (Python/pytest supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- Python project with pyproject.toml configuration
- Multi-library structure (agno + agno_infra)
- Extensive optional dependencies for AI/ML integrations
- pytest configured with async support and coverage
- Complex test matrix due to many optional integrations

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports Python pytest
- Should handle async test execution correctly
- May need consideration for optional dependency tests
- Large dependency matrix may cause some test failures

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio to verify pytest async handling
2. Consider testing with minimal dependencies first
3. May need to run with specific test markers to avoid integration tests
4. Check if workspace structure affects test discovery
