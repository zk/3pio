# 3pio Test Report: Vitest

**Project**: vitest
**Framework(s)**: JavaScript (Vitest) - supported by 3pio
**Test Date**: 2025-09-15
**3pio Version**: (from build)

## Project Analysis
- Project type: JavaScript testing framework (tests itself with Vitest)
- Test framework(s): Vitest (self-testing with custom configurations)
- Test command(s): `pnpm test` (filter to test-core), multiple test configurations
- Test suite size: Large pnpm monorepo testing framework with comprehensive self-tests

## 3pio Test Results
### Command: `../../build/3pio pnpm test`
- **Status**: NOT TESTED
- **Exit Code**: N/A
- **Detection**: Expected to work (JavaScript/Vitest supported)
- **Output**: Not executed yet

### Project Structure
- pnpm workspace monorepo with packages/* and test/* structure
- Vitest testing itself with multiple configurations and filters
- Complex test matrix: threads, browser, ecosystem CI, examples
- Self-referential: Vitest testing framework testing itself

### Expected Compatibility
- 3pio supports JavaScript Vitest
- Should detect Vitest correctly (self-referential case)
- May need pnpm workspace setup for dependency resolution
- Complex test filtering may require special handling

### Recommendations
1. Test with 3pio to verify Vitest self-testing works
2. Try individual packages: `cd packages/vitest && pnpm test`
3. Check if pnpm workspace filtering works with 3pio
4. May need specific test target: `pnpm --filter test-core test`
