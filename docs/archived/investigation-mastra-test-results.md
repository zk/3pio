# 3pio Testing Issues with Mastra

## Summary

Tested 3pio with the Mastra repository (https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) and encountered several issues:

## Issues Found

### 1. Test Runner Detection Works Correctly
- **Finding**: 3pio successfully detected Vitest when invoked through `pnpm test` in the monorepo
- **Behavior**: The test execution proceeded as expected, attempting to run all tests
- **Test Failures**: The failures were due to missing built dependencies in the Mastra project, not 3pio detection issues

### 2. Build Dependencies
- **Problem**: Tests fail due to missing built packages (`@mastra/schema-compat`, `@mastra/core/base`)
- **Context**: Mastra is a monorepo that requires packages to be built before tests can run
- **Impact**: 3pio correctly attempts to run tests but the underlying project isn't ready

### 3. Test Output Capture
- **Finding**: 3pio successfully captured the test failure output and created a report at `.3pio/runs/20250911T084241-goofy-schala/test-run.md`
- **Good**: The error details are properly captured including stack traces and error messages
- **Note**: The output includes ANSI color codes which are preserved in the report

## Test Environment

- Repository: Mastra (monorepo with pnpm workspaces)
- Test command: `pnpm test` (maps to `vitest run`)
- Test framework: Vitest 3.2.4
- Package manager: pnpm 10.12.4

## Recommendations

1. **Pre-build Check**: Consider documenting that projects may need to be built before running tests with 3pio
2. **Monorepo Support**: The current implementation handles monorepos correctly - it runs tests from the root
3. **Error Reporting**: The error capture and reporting worked well, providing detailed failure information

## Conclusion

3pio successfully:
- Detected the Vitest test runner
- Attempted to run the tests
- Captured and reported the failures

The failures were due to the Mastra project needing to be built first (missing `pnpm build`), not issues with 3pio itself. The tool correctly handled the test runner detection and error reporting for this complex monorepo setup.
