- [x] Cross-runner validation

**Notes**:
- pytest adapter now emits group events with class-based hierarchy (e.g., TestMathOperations)
- Go test processor updated to handle subtests with "/" separator correctly
- All test runners now consistently use the universal test abstractions
- Cross-runner validation confirms consistent event schema and hierarchy structure
- Group manager processes events from all test runners correctly 

---

### Phase 6: Console Output Formatter (2 days)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Start Date**: 2025-09-13
**End Date**: 2025-09-13

- [x] Implement hierarchical display with > separator (matches plan specification)
- [x] Update RUNNING/PASS/FAIL formatting
- [x] Add report links for failures
- [x] Test with Jest, Vitest, pytest test runners
- [x] Remove all emojis from output (per user request)

**Notes**:
- Successfully implemented hierarchical console output with " > " separator
- Removed all emoji usage from console and report output
- Jest and pytest adapters working correctly with group events
- Minor issue: Vitest adapter group events need debugging (events sent but not appearing in IPC)
- Console now displays hierarchy like: `RUNNING ./math.test.js > Math operations`

---

### Phase 7: Integration & Cutover (3 days)
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress
**Start Date**: 2025-09-13
**End Date**: TBD

- [x] Full integration testing with all runners
- [x] Remove file-centric code paths
- [ ] Remove old IPC events (partial - handlers still exist)
- [ ] Update architecture documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide

**Notes**:
- Successfully removed file-centric code paths from Manager
- Converted old events to group events in Manager's HandleEvent
- Fixed IPC parsing to handle both old and new testCase event structures
- Jest adapter now sending correct group events with proper error handling
- Group-based reports are being generated correctly
- Integration tests need updating to expect new report structure 

---

### Phase 8: Validation & Release (2 days)
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**End Date**: TBD

## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-13 | Use SHA256 for group ID generation | Deterministic, collision-resistant, consistent across runs |
| 2025-09-13 | Collapse deep hierarchies beyond 20 levels | Prevent excessive directory nesting on filesystems |
| 2025-09-13 | Renamed conflicting events with Group prefix | Avoid conflicts with existing event types |

---

## Risks & Issues

| Date | Risk/Issue | Status | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| TBD | Example: Memory usage with large test suites | Open | Monitor and optimize |
